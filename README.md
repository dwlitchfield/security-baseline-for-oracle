# Litchfield's Security Baseline for Oracle

This project defines a security baseline for Oracle database servers and provides a tool to measure compliance against the baseline.

# What's here?

the_baseline.pdf: A document describing the security baseline and the verification tool used to check for compliance.

AddendumtotheOracle12cCISGuidelines.pdf: This is an Addendum to the CIS Guidelines for Oracle 12c that contains 32 additional security checks.

oracle_audit_plan.pdf: A document and list of actions to be audited and the rationale under this security baseline. This also contains an SQL script for enabling the audit items.

hardening_summary_for_oracle.pdf: A list of changes that need to be made. 

dssc.rb: A security baseline verification tool written it Ruby. This reads in a list of SELECT queries that are executed to determine if a database system is compliant.

queries.xml: The list of queries.

orcl.xml: A sample database connection configuration file.


# Running the Baseline Verification Tool

First off, have you installed the Oracle instant client and ruby-oci8?
If not, please do so :)

*** Install ruby-oci8 first ****

```
mkdir -p /opt/oracle
cd /opt/oracle 
mv ~/Downloads/i*.zip /opt/oracle/
unzip instantclient-sdk-macos.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip
unzip instantclient-basic-macos.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip
unzip instantclient-sqlplus-macos.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip
OCI_DIR=/opt/oracle/instantclient_12_1; export OCI_DIR
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_12_1; export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/instantclient_12_1; export ORACLE_HOME
RC_ARCHS=x86_64; export RC_ARCHS
gem install ruby-oci8
```

*** Running ***

```$ ruby dssc.rb queries.xml orcl.xml```

queries.xml contains the SQL select queries that are used to determine compliance with the baseline.
orcl.xml is the configuration file that contains the database connection information. A sample configuration file called orcl.xml exists in the repository.


-- Send results to stdout 
```
$ ruby dssc.rb queries.xml orcl.xml
```

-- Redirect results to file 
```
$ ruby dssc.rb queries.xml orcl.xml > results.xml
```
